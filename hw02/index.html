  CSS is the primary means we use today to make our HTML documents look the way we want, or more often, the way the designers we'll work with want the pages to look.
  </p>

  <p>
  This assignment will focus on transforming the look of some existing HTML, particularly focusing on how to target specific HTML elements, while avoiding others.

  <h2>Problem 1 - 40 points</h2>

  <p>
  The first step with CSS is to figure out how to target the elements you're interested in. In this problem you will have to target various elements and add a CSS declaration to them.
  </p>

  <p>
  There are two files you will be using for this problem: <tt>problem1.html</tt> and <tt>problem1.css</tt>. You are <strong>not</strong> allowed to modify problem1.html in any way. All changes will be made <strong>only in problem1.css</strong>. You will of course need to look at the contents of problem1.html, but you may not edit it at all.
  </p>

  <p>
  Here is what problem1.html looks like in a browser before modifying the CSS file:

  <h3>Part a)</h3>
  
  <p>
    Add the following rule to <tt>problem1.css</tt> such that all the text on the page is affected, and the background color is changed. You will need to change <tt>???</tt> to be the appropriate selector. We're changing the font-face from the default serif font to a sans-serif font.
  </p>
  
  <pre class="code">??? {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  background-color: #84d2e2;

  <h2>Problem 2 - 40 points</h2>
  
  <p>
    Next we will flip it around. For this problem, <tt>problem2.css</tt> has a series of rules already present. You will need to modify <tt>problem2.html</tt> so that it matches the following picture. In this case you may not modify the CSS file at all, only modify the HTML file to match the following image. You will need to add several HTML elements to the document in order to have it match.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Note that this design will not scale very well if your browser window gets too wide or too narrow.  So try adjusting your browser window width to match the rough width of the image for best results.

  <h2>Problem 3 - 10 points</h2>
  
  <p>
    For this problem, you will back to updating a CSS file, <tt>problem3.css</tt>. You will make <tt>problem3.html</tt> look the same as the image below, by only adding CSS rules to <tt>problem3.css</tt>

  <h2>Problem 4 - 10 points</h2>
  
  <p>
    This problem deals with CSS precedent and specificity. The file <tt>problem4.html</tt> has two CSS files linked to it. You are only allowed to modify <tt>problem4.css</tt> and may not change, add, or remove rules to <tt>problem4-x.css</tt>. You may also not edit <tt>problem4.html</tt>.
  </p>
    
    <p>
    Here's what the page looks like to begin with, with only the rules from problem4-x.css applied:
    </p>
    <figure>
    <img src="images/p4-start.png">
    </figure>
    
    
  <p>
    Create as many new CSS rules in <tt>problem4.css</tt> as are required to accomplish the following: 
  </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Set the text color of the elements under the "Costs" section to 'orange'.</li>
        <li>Set the background color of the top level list items to 'lightgray'.</li>
        <li>Fix the bottom margins of the children of section 2 so that they're right below the item above it.  Leave the space between items 1 and 2 the same.</li>
        <li>Fix the text size of sections i and ii to only be '1em'.</li>
        <li>Remember <strong><em>you may not</em></strong> alter <tt>problem4.css</tt> or <tt>problem4.html</tt> for this problem.</li>
    </ul>
