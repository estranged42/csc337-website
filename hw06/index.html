  <h2>Problem 1: Monty Hall Front-End (100 points)</h2>
  
  <p>
    The remaining two assignments for the semester have you implement a client-server AJAX based web application to play the Monty Hall game. If you're not familiar with this problem, or want a deeper dive into it, see the WikiPedia article for it: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The basics of the game work like this:
    <ol>
      <li>The Player is presented with 3 closed doors.  There is a prize behind one of the doors.
      <li>The Player first selects one door, but does not open it.
      <li>The Host then opens one of the doors the Player did not choose. The Host will <strong>always</strong> open a door with no prize behind it.
      <li>The Player is then given a final choice: stick with the original door the player selected, or switch their choice to the other door that the Host did not open.
      <li>Finally the Host reveals the door containing the prize, and the Player either wins or looses.
    </ol>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For this assignment you will create a web page front-end for the Monty Hall problem.  The front-end communicates via the AJAX technique with a back-end API.  For this first part, I have implemented a reference API back-end you can all use to test your front-ends against.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For assignment 7, you will implement the PHP/MySQL based back-end API.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Minimum Requirements</h3>
  
  <p>
    You will have 3 main components to your web page:
    <ul>
      <li>3 Doors to click on
      <li>A message box to display messages to the Player
      <li>A table of win/loss stats
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Door behavior:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>When you click on a door to select it, you will need to indicate that it is selected in some way.
    <li>When the incorrect door is 'opened', indicate that the door is incorrect somehow.
    <li>When the final prize door is 'opened' indicate that that door held the prize somehow.
  </ul>

  <p>
    Message Box behavior. There are three required messages that should be displayed. The door number printed to the Player should <strong>not</strong> be zero indexed.  So the first door should be door 1, and the last door should be door 3. Only convert door indexes when displaying door numbers to the Player.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>New Game! Choose a door.
    <li>Door 2 doesn't have the prize. Choose your first door again, or switch?
    <li>Win/Loose:
        <ul>
          <li>You Won! Door 1 had the prize!
          <li>You Lost. Door 1 had the prize.
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Stats Table
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Table should show stats at the beginning of the game
    <li>Stats should be updated when the game is over
  </ul>

  <h3>Extra Credit (5 points)</h3>
  
  <p>
    Five points of extra credit are available if you choose to make the game look better.  Ideas include, but are not limited to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Make doors look more like doors
    <li>Animate door openings
    <li>Have something behind the prize door
    <li>Have something behind the incorrect doors
    <li>Make the front-end page mobile-responsive (indicate this in your submission so we test it)
    <li>... other ideas?
  </ul>
