  <h2>Problem 1: Box Model - 50 points</h2>
  
  <p>
    You have been given a basic design mockup as an image. The image is below. (Click on it for a larger version). You must create the HTML and CSS to create the design as a web page. There are a series of measurements to assist you:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>The width of the main content container is 800px.
    <li>The red gradient header section is 800px wide.
    <li>The header uses <tt>header.png</tt> for a background.
    <li>The text for the header should be white, and a sans-serif font.
    <li>The text for the header should be closer to the bottom.
    <li>The red header area should touch the very top of the page.
  </ul>
  
  <ul>
    <li>The right sidebar is 200px wide.
    <li>The buttons in the sidebar are 200px wide.
    <li>The buttons in the sidebar should use <tt>button-background.gif</tt> for their backgrounds.
    <li>The buttons in the sidebar should have a 5px padding.
    <li>The spacing between the header and the sidebar buttons is 20px.
    <li>The spacing between the sidebar buttons is 10px.
    <li>There is a slight drop shadow on the text in the buttons.  Use <tt>1px 1px 2px black</tt> for the value of this property.
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>The main content area is 600px wide.
    <li>The space between the header and the content is 20px.
    <li>The <tt>thumbnail.png</tt> image is 150px wide and 150px tall.
    <li>The space between the thumbnail image and the text to the right and below is 20px.
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>The footer area is 800px wide.
    <li>The padding inset for the footer area is 20px.
    <li>The background color for the footer shall be #84d2e2.
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Some additional rules for your HTML and CSS:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>You may not use any <tt>&lt;table&gt;</tt> elements.
    <li>You do not have to use the exact text blocks from the mockup. Use a similar amount of filler text for the sidebar and main content area. The main content should still have three paragraphs.
    <li>You're not given any guidance or requirements on various font sizes. This is typical. Use your best judgment for measuring differences in font sizes from the mockup.
  </ul>

  <h2>Problem 3: Positioning - 30 points</h2>
  
  <p>
    Precisely positioning elements for a layout is very important. In this problem you will need to create a CSS file <tt>problem3.css</tt> which will contain rules to change <tt>problem3.html</tt> to look and perform like the following images and video. You may not modify the contents of <tt>problem3.html</tt>, only add CSS rules to <tt>problem3.css</tt>.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Each of the three main boxes is the same size, 150px tall and 150px wide.
    <li>Each of the three main boxes has 4 positioned blocks within it, one each in the four corners.
    <li>The smaller boxes in the corners of the main boxes should be blue, and be 25px wide and 25px tall.
    <li>The main boxes have a green border, which is dotted and 5px thick.
    <li>#block1 should be positioned in the upper-right corner of the page on page load, and should scroll with the page. It should touch the top, and be 50 pixels from the right edge of the window.
    <li>#block1 should have a background image of <tt>one.gif</tt> as shown.
    <li>#block2 should be positioned 200 pixels from the top of the page, along the left edge. It should not scroll with the page.
    <li>#block2 should have a background image of <tt>two.gif</tt> as shown.
    <li>#block3 should be positioned at the bottom of the window on page load, and should scroll with the page.
    <li>#block3 should be positioned 45% of the way from the left side of the window.
